# JavaFXmoleGame
My Final Project.


Hello! In this repo you'll find all the files needed to run my game. 
Game details: Click as many moles as you can before the computer does to win the game, the game ends when all of the moles on the screen are gone. 
- Some moles are actually bombs, clicking them will cause you to lose a point!
- The computer will always gain a point when it clicks a mole!
- Try all 5 difficulties, Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, and God mode!
- (god mode may not be humanly possible)
